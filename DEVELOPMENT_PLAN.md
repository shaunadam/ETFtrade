# Phase 4: Flask Web Application Improvements - Development Plan

## Overview
Enhance the existing Flask application with professional trading features, improved user experience, and comprehensive functionality based on the available data and infrastructure.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Stock Screener Charting Implementation
- **Add Interactive Price Charts**: Implement Plotly.js charts in screener results showing:
  - Price action with volume
  - Technical indicators (SMA20/50/200, RSI, Bollinger Bands)
  - Trade setup visualization (entry/exit points)
  - Regime indicators overlay
- **Chart Integration**: 
  - Add chart buttons to results table
  - Modal popup charts for quick analysis
  - Full-page chart view with detailed analysis
- **Technical Enhancement**: Use existing cached indicator data from the database

### 2. Progress Bar Standardization
- **Unified Progress System**: Create consistent progress feedback across all operations:
  - Screener scanning progress
  - Backtest execution progress  
  - Data cache refresh progress
  - Chart loading states
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket or polling for live progress updates
- **User Experience**: Professional loading states with meaningful status messages

### 3. Selective Backtesting from Screener
- **Instrument Selection**: Allow users to select specific stocks/ETFs from screener results
- **Batch Backtesting**: Run backtests on selected instruments instead of all instruments
- **Integration**: Seamless workflow from screener → selection → backtest → results
- **Performance**: Optimized backtesting for selected subsets

### 4. Professional Trading Tools
Based on available data and professional trading needs:
- **Correlation Matrix**: Real-time correlation analysis between instruments
- **Sector Rotation Dashboard**: Track sector performance and rotation patterns
- **Risk Management Tools**: 
  - Portfolio heat map
  - Position sizing calculator
  - Risk/reward visualization
- **Market Scanner**: Real-time market movers and unusual volume detection
- **Regime Analysis Dashboard**: Deep dive into market regime transitions

### 5. Enhanced User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile-friendly layouts
- **Data Export**: Complete CSV/JSON export functionality
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced filtering across all data views
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading for large datasets
- **Toast Notifications**: Comprehensive user feedback system

### 6. Code Quality & Architecture
- **Service Layer**: Complete all placeholder implementations
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
- **API Consistency**: Standardize all API endpoints
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
- **Documentation**: Update inline documentation
