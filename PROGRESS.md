# ETF Trading System - Development Progress

## Current Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-05  
**Current Phase**: Phase 3 Complete - Flask Web Application Production Ready  
**Next Phase**: Phase 4 - Trade Journal Integration

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Strategy Foundation âœ…
- Market regime detection across 4 dimensions
- 13 comprehensive trade setups
- Intelligent data caching system (95% API reduction)
- Database schema with price_data and indicators tables

### Phase 2: Screener + Backtest Engine âœ…
- Production CLI screener with regime-aware filtering
- Export capabilities (CSV/JSON)
- Walk-forward backtesting engine
- Risk-free rate integration for accurate Sharpe ratios

### Phase 3: Basic Flask Web Application âœ…
- Modular Flask application with 5 complete modules
- Dark Bootstrap 5 theme with professional trading UI
- Service layer architecture integrating all CLI modules
- Interactive dashboards with Plotly.js charts
- Complete API endpoints for all functionality

### Phase 4: Flask Web Application Improvement
- Implement charting on stock screener
- Review existing functionality for placeholders or things to be developed later - tidy these up
- Standardize progress bars so user feedback is clear across all operations while pending
- All users to select stocks from screener results to run backtest on (instead of all instruments)
- Act as a professional trader. What other tools are useful with the data we have available (outisde of future planned phases already identified)

### Phase 5: Trade Journal Integration ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Implement trade journal functionality
- [ ] Add correlation tracking
- [ ] Web interface for trade management

### Phase 6: Reporting Tools ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Performance reporting vs benchmarks
- [ ] Daily/weekly reporting capabilities
- [ ] Regime-based performance analysis

### Phase 7: Optimization & Expansion ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Strategy refinement and optimization
- [ ] Parameter optimization tools
- [ ] Dynamic production parameter optimization

## Major Achievements

### Technical Performance
- **Cache Size**: 17,366+ price records, 140,000+ indicator values
- **API Optimization**: 95%+ reduction in yfinance API calls
- **Speed**: Screening 50+ ETFs in seconds vs minutes
- **Database**: Risk-free rate system with 972+ rate records

### System Completeness
- **Complete Trade Setup Suite**: 13 setups covering all major patterns
- **Dual Interface**: Full CLI + professional web application
- **Production Ready**: Both interfaces ready for daily trading use
- **Professional UI**: Dark Bootstrap theme with trading-specific design

### Data Quality
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 53 symbols with full history
- **Healing Strategy**: Ensures 200+ day buffer for technical indicators
- **Zero Warnings**: Eliminated cache warnings after proper bootstrapping

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **CLI Tools**: screener.py, data_cache.py, regime_detection.py, trade_setups.py, backtest.py
- **Flask App**: 5 modules (dashboard, screener, regime, data, backtest)
- **Database**: SQLite with price_data, indicators, market_regimes, risk_free_rates tables
- **Caching**: Smart refresh strategy with graceful fallback

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, yfinance, pandas, numpy
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, Plotly.js, Jinja2 templates
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive schema
- **Testing**: pytest, ruff, mypy

## Next Steps (Phase 4 and then these after):
1. Design and implement trade journal functionality
2. Add correlation tracking for portfolio management
3. Expand Flask web interface with trade management features
4. Integrate journal functionality with existing screener workflow

## Success Metrics
- Beat SPY by 2%+ annually after costs
- Stay within 20% maximum drawdown
- Positive performance across market regimes
- <30 minutes daily maintenance

## Notes
- Using WSL2 Linux environment
- Equal focus on ETFs and individual stocks
- Target: 20% max drawdown, decades-long time horizon
- **Production Ready**: Both CLI and web interfaces complete and tested
