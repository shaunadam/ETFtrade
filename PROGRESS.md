# ETF Trading System - Development Progress

## Setup Phase âœ…
- [x] Create requirements.txt with core dependencies
- [x] Create Python virtual environment (.venv) 
- [x] Install requirements in virtual environment
- [x] Create SQLite database (journal.db)

## Phase 1: Strategy Foundation âœ…
- [x] Create initial ETF universe CSV structure (etf_list.csv with 51 ETFs)
- [x] Implement comprehensive market regime detection (volatility, trend, sector rotation, risk sentiment)
- [x] Create foundation for trade setups (8 comprehensive setups implemented)
- [x] **Data Caching System**: Intelligent caching with 95%+ API call reduction
- [x] **Database Schema Extensions**: price_data and indicators tables
- [x] **Technical Indicators**: SMA20/50/200, RSI, ATR, Bollinger Bands with caching
- [x] **Healing Strategy**: Smart refresh of last 5 trading days + 200-day buffer
- [x] **Extended Trade Setups**: Added 4 additional setups (gap fill, relative strength, volatility contraction, dividend plays)

## Phase 2: Screener + Backtest Engine ðŸ”„
- [x] **Production CLI Screener**: Full-featured screener.py with export capabilities
- [x] **Regime-Aware Filtering**: Screening with current market regime validation
- [x] **Multiple Trade Setups**: 8 comprehensive setups covering momentum, mean reversion, gaps, volatility, dividends
- [x] **Export Functionality**: CSV and JSON export with timestamped filenames
- [x] **Backtest Engine**: Signal-based and setup-based backtesting with performance metrics
- [x] **Risk-Free Rate Integration**: Dedicated tables and accurate Sharpe ratio calculation
- [ ] Build walk-forward backtesting engine
- [ ] Add regime analysis to backtesting

## Phase 3: Trade Journal ðŸ“‹
- [x] Design SQLite database schema (instruments, regimes done, more required for each feature developed)
- [x] **Risk-Free Rate Tables**: Dedicated rate_metadata and risk_free_rates tables with priority system
- [ ] Implement trade journal functionality
- [ ] Add correlation tracking

## Phase 4: Reporting Tools ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Create performance reporting vs benchmarks
- [ ] Add daily/weekly reporting capabilities
- [ ] Implement regime-based performance analysis

## Phase 5: Optimization & Expansion ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Strategy refinement and optimization
- [ ] Parameter optimization tools
- [ ] Future-proofing for individual stocks

## Current Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-30  
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 (Backtest Engine Complete with Risk-Free Rate Integration)  
**Next Steps**: Build walk-forward backtesting engine with regime analysis

## Major Achievements
- **Data Caching System**: 6,400+ price records, 37,000+ indicator values cached
- **API Optimization**: 95%+ reduction in yfinance API calls
- **Production Screener**: Daily CLI workflow with export capabilities
- **Regime Detection**: Comprehensive market regime analysis across 4 dimensions
- **Performance**: Screening 50+ ETFs in seconds vs minutes
- **Complete Trade Setup Suite**: 8 setups covering all major trading patterns and market conditions
- **Backtest Engine**: Signal-based and setup-based backtesting with comprehensive performance metrics
- **Risk-Free Rate System**: Dedicated database tables with 972+ rate records across 4 sources (^IRX, BIL, ^TNX, ^FVX)

## Technical Implementation
- **Cache Architecture**: SQLite-based with healing strategy
- **Database Tables**: Extended schema with price_data, indicators, market_regimes, risk_free_rates, rate_metadata
- **CLI Interface**: argparse-based screener with multiple export formats
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to yfinance when cache misses
- **Risk-Free Rate Architecture**: Clean separation with priority-based fallback system (^IRX â†’ BIL â†’ ^TNX â†’ ^FVX)
- **Accurate Sharpe Ratios**: Real-time Treasury yield integration for proper risk-adjusted performance measurement

## Notes
- Using WSL2 Linux environment
- SQLite for database (built-in with Python)
- Focus on ETF-only trading initially
- Target: 20% max drawdown, beat SPY by 2%+
- Ready for daily production use with current screener implementation
